# learnPython

In this repository I document my journey through learning Python.

Python is easy to learn, easy to read and write, and powerful. You can learn Python frameworks like Django, and build full-blown apps. Or you can learn data-science like pandas, matplotlib,scikit-learn.

Here is a brief list of resources I used for this:

To learn Python, the `hard way`:

 - [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex25.html)

To learn cool data sciency Python things:

 - [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com)

To `google` Python things:
