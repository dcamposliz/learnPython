**Math Operators**

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Operator   |	Operation      	|	Example	   |	Evaluates to..
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 **		Exponent		2 ** 3		8
 %		Modulus/reminder	22 % 8		6
 //		Integer division	22 // 8		2
 /		Division		22 / 8		2.75
 *		Multiplication		3 * 5		15
 -		Subtraction		5 - 2		3
 +		Addition		2 + 2		4
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The order of operations (also called precedence) of Python math operators is similar to that of mathematics. The ** operator is evaluated first, the *, /, //, and % operators are evaluated next, from left to right, and the + and - are evaluated last (also from left to right). You can use parenthesis to override the usual precedence if you need to.

	>>> 2 + 3 * 6

	20

	>>> (2 + 3) * 6

	30

	>>> (5 - 1) * ((7 - 1) / (3 - 1))

	16.0

There is a bunch of other basic Python stuff that we are going to skip because it's boring.

**Your First Program**

	print('Hello World!')
	print('What is your name?')
	myName = input()
	print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)
	print('The length of your name is: ')
	print(len(myName))
	print('What is your age?')
	myAge = input()
	print('You will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + ' in a year.')

**Some Useful Functions**

`print()`

`input()`

`len()`

`str()`

`int()`

`float()`
