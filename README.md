# learnPython

In this repository I document my journey through learning `Python`. **To see the code, explore the directories above.**

## WHY PYTHON

`Python` is easy to learn, easy to read and write, and powerful. You can learn `Python` frameworks like `Django`, and build full-blown apps. Or you can **run data science jobs** with libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` or even `spark`.
