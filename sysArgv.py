#random exercise to better understand argv

import sys
print sys.argv

# for this program we tried running the following
# $ python sysArgv.py
# $ python sysArgv.py a b c
# $ python sysArgv.py hello world

# seems like argv simply just takes the arguments passed
# to the program, and holds them as variables...
# and then we can do whatever the fuck we want with them
