# importing some sort of library argv from
# directory sys 
from sys import argv

# we are assigning a value of argv that we
# imported from sys to the variables
# script, first, second, and third
script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third

# for some reason script prints something 
# different than first, second, and third
# is this because "script" has a
# pre-determined value ?
