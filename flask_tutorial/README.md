# The Flask Tutorial

Flask is a microframework.

## Requirements

Flask depends on external libraries like `Werkzeug` (toolkit for `WSGI`, the standard Python interface between web applications and a variety of servers for both dev and deployment) and `Jinga2` (a toolkit for rendering templates).

We will also need Python 2.x and `virtualenv`. Google how to to install Python 2, if you haven't, already.

Install `virtualenv`:

  sudo pip install virtualenv

Install `Flask` globally:

  sudo pip install Flask

Maybe do upgrade your pip setup tools:

  pip2 install --upgrade pip setuptools
