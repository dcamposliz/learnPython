# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly the way it is:

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nAug"

print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

print """

There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.

# seems that no mistakes were made in this one :)
