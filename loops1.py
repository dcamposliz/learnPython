# we are declaring a list to be an array
# of integers, 5 integers, to be specific
exampleList = [1,3,454,6,56]

# then we declare a for loop, where we iterate
# through the list we just created :)
# this actually executes when we run the script

print "We are running a for loop on a list"
for eachNumber in exampleList:
	print(eachNumber)

print "We are running a while loop on a range"
for x in range(1,11):
	print x
