# Machine Learning with Python 3

Machine Learning was pioneered in the 1950s by [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel), who introduced work on neural networks.

Then in the 1960s [Vladimir Vapnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vapnik) was one of the co-inventors of support vector machines, which were overlooked until around the 1990s, when he was scooped out of Russia by Bell Labs in the US.

At this time, support vector machines were more popular and powerful than neural networks. Most recently, Google has advanced neural networks specifically through deep learning.

`Scikit-learn` is one of the tools we will be using.

# Regression

Requirements:

 - `quandl`

 - `pandas`

To install, on execute on terminal:

	virtualenv -p usr/bin/python3 venv

	source venv/bin/activate

	pip install quandl

	pip install pandas

	pip list

	pip freeze --local > requirements.txt

Regression finds the best-fit line for 'continous' data.
